			<p class="p">This is the world of art. Any and all pictures that I took of my art work. Pictures of progress, pictures of the over all piece, and  pitures of art. 
The main purpose of this project in my own words was to make people really think about things that goes on in life and to get a powerful statement out there that you thought people should know. The purpose was to make people think about life and the things that are in their lives.

        <p>Jan 4th, 2016<br><br>
 
In Don’t Google for Love I created a , painting.based from soundwaves. 
In this painting I  created an interpretation of soundwaves based from an audio recording of my voice saying the statement”Don’t google for love”. I chose this statement because It is very powerful and many people think that they could find their soulmate on Google. Once they meet that person they aren’t the person they say they are on google. You are searching on google for strangers that you wish to have relations with and it doesn’t work out in the end. You never know who you are meeting so don’t google for love. If it’s love then let it come to you and don’t google for strangers. This statement is powerful because its telling people not to google for love. Google has answers for a lot of things but love isn’t one of them . 

Color adds to the overall meaning of the work because red is one color that represents love and  blue provides a cool contrast to the red, making the red stand out. I chose these colors because they work  well together. The colors make the statement stand out even more by drawing attention through high contrast and bold colors. I want people to pay attention and question the statement “Don’t Google for Love.</p>

        <h3 class="title">How I Did It </h3><br><br>
          <p>The steps we took in doing this project was to first pick 15 words out of a basket and come up with as many statements as possible that we thought was powerful. We then wrote them all down and hung them up in the hall. We went around and marked the ones that we felt were the most powerful out of them all. Next came picking the one that you really wanted to work with. The next step was to record our-self saying the statement. We projected the sound waves of our voices and traced them on a large sheet of drawing paper. We shaded in the back of the drawing paper so that we could trace it on to a piece of wood. Some people didn’t trace theirs on wood because they made the soundwaves out of strips of wood. 
	There were three choices of how you could do this project but I’m only going to talk about the one that I selected to use. I picked paint because I have a real neat hand and I really love to paint. After tracing my soundwaves on to the wood I  had to decide on a color scheme.  I chose colors that would go great with the statement and that would also make the soundwave imagepop out and be even more powerful.Color adds to the overall meaning of the work because red is one color that represents love and  blue provides a cool contrast to the red, making the red stand out. I chose these colors because they work  well together. The colors make the statement stand out even more by drawing attention through high contrast and bold colors.

          <p>My thoughts upon this project are it was a great project. It was very fun to do. This was one of the most creative projects I've seen all my years in school and im a junior so I only have a year left and this projectis manking my experience here at Chi Tech very good. I think that they should do this project with other classes of other years as well so that they all could have the same experience that    </p>
