        <p>High school dropout benefit and why you should stay in school 


When dropping out of high school you really don’t have as many benefits as you would if you stayed in high school. When graduating from high school you get way more benefits as you would if you dropped out of high school.

According to dropout prevention “Nationally, 59 percent of state prison inmates are dropouts’’. Meaning that dropping out isn’t going to do you no good but mess your life up. When you drop out of high school most people don’t tell their parents and just roam the streets, and roaming the streets isn’t going to do anything but get you into some type of trouble.

All you want to do is make money and lots of it and you think dropping out is going to make you more money but it really isn’t. According to career connections “Typically high school dropouts earn $19,000 a year. High school graduates earn $28,000’’. What they are saying is that if you really want to make money than you should stay in high school, because high school graduates make way more money than a high school dropout. 

To me you shouldn’t drop out of high school because dropping out isn’t going to get you far in the real world maybe nowhere and you shouldn’t want that. If you drop out of high school then you are either going to end up being ok, in jail, on the streets, or dead.  I say this because some people are ok if they drop out but most others aren’t. They are either at home or on the streets being a drug dealer or getting involved with some gang. Which is going to get them in jail or either messing with the wrong gang and are going to end up dead. If you go to school and graduate then you can do more things the right way. As well as become more successful in life. 

You’ve had enough with your classes being boring, your teachers act like your parents, how is the things they’re teaching you going to help you in the real world, you just want to make money. Well guess what they are doing these things to help you make it in life. You want to make money well you aren’t going to make that much money if you drop out of school. School has everything to do with the real world, school is teaching you everything that you need to know about the real world and how to survive in the real world. 

What I’m trying to say is that dropping out of high school isn’t going to do anything for you in the real world. Stay in school get an education, graduate, and don’t drop out. <br><br>

We all take pictures all everyday all day and thats another reason why we love this job. At the end of every session we have a photoshoot where they would provide us with things to wear according to the theme and we would take so many pictures. Just this last session we took so many pictures and so many poses. We would go out in front of cars and they will stop and let us take picture. It's very wonderful.  </p>
